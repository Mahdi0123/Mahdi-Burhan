   <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <img src="https://placeimg.com/320/240/arch/grayscale?t=1531603312782" alt="world">
      <p>My name is Mahdi Burhan, and for the past 2 years, I've been in the business world working as a Financial Controller. I have recently returned to university so that i can finish my bachelor degree. In my spare time i love to program.
        
        I ventured into programming because i was always interested in how websites are made, and i didn't just want to be comfortable with what i already knew. It is also important to not stagnate in modern times with so much information out there. It was just a given for me to also get into software development</p>
    
  <p>Besides working, studying and programming i love spending time with friends and family, and can often be found together going out catching the latest movie, staying in playing games on the sofa or planning a trip to someplace I've never been before. 
    
  When not at work I'm usually working on a new project from home which could be anything from recreating a site to making a cool little game. I spend a lot of time learning new techniques</p>
